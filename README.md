# Nutrien Backend Technical Assessment

See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](/INSTRUCTIONS.md) for some background on what we're building.

## Getting Started

To boot up in Development mode, simply run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

This will run and attach to necessary processes. Everything (installing dependencies, booting up, connecting to the database, etc) is handled by Docker. Sourcecode is mounted directly into the service container for development and does not represent a Production-ready build. File changes will restart the server to assist in active development.

## Testing

// TODO
